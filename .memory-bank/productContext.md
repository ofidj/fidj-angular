# Product Context: fidj-angular

## Why This Project Exists
fidj-angular exists to provide Angular-specific implementations of fidj functionality, making it easier for developers to integrate fidj capabilities into Angular applications. It bridges the gap between the core fidj-node library and Angular's framework-specific patterns and requirements.

## Problems It Solves
- Simplifies integration of fidj functionality into Angular applications
- Handles Angular-specific lifecycle management
- Provides Angular services and modules that follow Angular best practices
- Reduces boilerplate code needed to use fidj in Angular projects

## How It Should Work
The library should:
- Provide Angular services that wrap fidj-node functionality
- Follow Angular's dependency injection patterns
- Be easy to import and configure in Angular modules
- Provide clear TypeScript interfaces and types
- Maintain compatibility with Angular's change detection

## User Experience Goals
For developers using this library:
- Minimal configuration required to get started
- Intuitive API that follows Angular conventions
- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for better IDE support
- Clear documentation with examples
- Seamless integration with existing Angular applications
