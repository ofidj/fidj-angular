# Progress: fidj-angular

## What Works
- Core FidjModule and FidjService functionality
- Integration with fidj-node
- Angular service pattern implementation
- Build system using ng-packagr
- Documentation generation with TypeDoc
- Code quality tools (ESLint and Prettier)
- BP scripts for development workflow

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive test suite
- More detailed documentation and examples
- Potential upgrades to newer Angular versions
- Additional Angular-specific features
- Performance optimizations

## Current Status
The project is in a stable state with version 15.1.12. Recent work has focused on improving code quality and development workflow:
- Added linting and formatting
- Implemented BP scripts
- Updated documentation
- Fixed metadata in package.json and README.md

The library is functional and can be used in Angular 15.x applications, but there are opportunities for enhancement in testing, documentation, and features.

## Known Issues
- Limited test coverage
- Documentation could be more comprehensive
- No explicit compatibility testing with Angular versions beyond 15.x
- Dependency on specific fidj-node version may limit flexibility

The project is actively maintained, and these issues are being addressed as part of the ongoing development process.
